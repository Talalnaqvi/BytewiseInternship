INTRODUCTION:
During my first week as a Frontend Intern at Byte Wise, I have delved into the
foundational aspects of React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. I
learned how to create a new React application from scratch, which is essential for
setting up any React project. Additionally, I explored the various types of components in
React, understanding their distinct roles and functionalities. A significant part of my
learning also included JSX, the syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing
HTML-like code within React. This week has laid a strong foundation for my future work
in developing dynamic and efficient web applications.
HTML,CSS,JS:
In this task we refresh our core concepts or prerequisite for using react, i refresh my
ES6 syntax especially array of objects ,object literals,maps,filter,reduce, and other
things like traditional loops,functions, if-else conditionals,switch-cases etc
Creating a React App:
The second task of the internship is how to create a react app,in this task i learned
about the two approaches of creating a react app,the first approach uses
A command “npx create-react-app my-app” by using this command almost all the dev
dependencies will be installed including the dependencies that is used for testing
purpose, this approach takes time as it is the bulky one.
Using Vite:
The second way to create a react application is using vite,this approach is lighter than
the first approach, it can be done using “npm create@latest”.it only provides two
dependencies react-library and react dom.
Components in React:
Components in react is the most crucial part of react.Components are reusable just like
js functions,components only made at once at we can utilized them again and again as
per our need in App.jsx or App.js file
Two types Of Components:
First type of components is functional components,they dont follow the Object Oriented
Programming approach or class based approach,they are build using normal approach.
Second type of component is class Based approach in which we made classes and
inside those classes we defined our components
Components can be written in normal functions as well as arrow functions.
Task for my own Learning:
I have made a week mini project a product page in which i dynamically fetched and
show the data in the cards using props and array of objects
